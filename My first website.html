  <p>Who else doesn't know about squid game these days. <br>
  I love squid game because it it's thrilling scene and also<br>
  it shows how different perople would react in difficult situations <br>
whether its towards thier loved ones or towards strangers. <br>
It also taught us about how not to trust anyone  and the plot twist this series has, it's a top notch </p>

  <a href = "https://youtu.be/1Qx6Y7p2wPo?si=n3WVJ9GsMM_xpqNy" >Kagegurui trailer 2019</a>
  <p>Kagegurui live action is one of the best series for gambles movies for me. <br> 
   I like the series so much because the main lead is so pretty Not to mention she's 19 at that time same age as me right now<br> 
  The way she walks, the way she laughs, the way she acts and the uniform fits perfectly to her. <br> 
  everything about her is just magneficent </p>
